# COVEN-Consumers-Vendors-Unite
Brief summary:
A prototype platform made on Python used by consumers and roadside vendors. Vendors enter the data, of their location and item sold. Consumers enter the data of their needs and location. This data is stored in MySQL.

Coven: Where Consumers and Vendors Unite, is an initiative made for reducing the tremendous strain to food resources, that is causing a dilemma to farmers as well as consumers. The aim of our computer project is to come up with a prototype platform which can be used by both the vendors and the consumers. This python based platform allows the vendors to effectively communicate the whereabouts of their products, and allows the consumers to update their preferences, based on which the platform  interrelates the two different sets of data and establishes a match.

The key feature of our project is our integration of 2 different programming languages, python and sql. Using python, we have created a user-consumer friendly interface in which we ask the required information of the consumer/vendor who wants to contribute to this platform. Through conditional statements like if-else, we provide the requirements, and accordingly give him the area/product which he is in need or wants to sell in, along with the time allocated and other necessary conditions. 

To enhance the user’s participation and to make our project less readable and more visual, we have used data visualisation such as graphs though matplotlib pyplot module. We have also made use of the python imaging library, pillow, which is used to bring in pictures into python, to make it look more attractive.

To get more knowledge on our project’s aim and focus, only in case the user wants it, we have used file handling to explain it elaborately, where the user can easily get access to and read all the data he wants. We have implemented stacks- append, pop, lifo function- though python to input the user information, to store it and allocate it in the suitable place to work on it accordingly.

SQL is used to store all this information of the consumers and vendors so that they can excess it if required. We have created 3 tables- 1st is of the consumers information and priorities, 2nd is of the vendors information and priorities, 3rd is to show how our project has benefited the consumers and vendors during this pandemic situation, by showing the profit, along with graph data visualization. The user-consumer contact happens completely though python
